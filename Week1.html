    <h1>Bache INNOVATIVE</h1>
     <p><b>Bache INNOVATIVE </b> is an operating family runned textile production organization passed from generations to generations. It was first founded in 1927 by Otto Bache in Apolda/Thüringen, the former well known german knitting factory. </p>
        
        <p>They also have collaborate in  some researchs like this jacket anti slash or shoes.</p>
        <br> As we have to develop wearable devices, it was really interesting see how they work.

    <h1>3D modelling </h1>
        <p> We are using Autodesk Fusion 360 as 3D modelling software. </p>
        <center><img src="FotosWeek1/Autodesk_Fusion360.jpg"WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="200"></center>
        
        <p></p>
        <br>For modelling a joint, the first step is to have an idea of what kind of joint we would like to create depending on it's use.
       <br> Once i thought about the idea, i start creating the joint in Autodesk Fusion 360.
        <br> The workspace selected for this, it is Model, which let us create mechanical designs that contain mostly prismatic geometry. 
        <p></p>
        <br><b> Let’s start!</b>
 <br>The first thing is to choose the plane in which you want to work. Usually we are going to choose the top one. 
 <br>The next step was to draw a sphere with the sphere function. Then I drew a line using the sketch mode, to split it and remove one of the parts to have only a semi sphere. Once I had the semi sphere, I added a cylinder. This is going to be my mobile part. 
        <p></p>
 <br>Now I create the base. For this purpose I selected the sketch mode, and with the arc function I drew an arch around the sphere, leaving enough space to let it rotate on the inside. After that I draw the hole base. 
 <br>Once I had the closed sketch, I needed to transform it into a 3D body.
 <br>Now I selected the revolve function , inside the create tools. 
        <p></p>
 <br>Once I had the 3D figure, I needed to separate them.
 <br>For this task, as before I drew a line in the middle of the figure, and I used the split body.
        <p></p>
 <br>Then I created two holes in one of the bodies and two cylinders using extrude in the other body, so the cylinders could penetrate in the holes and join the two bodies.
